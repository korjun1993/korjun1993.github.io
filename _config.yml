about_content: |
  - I perform tasks that contribute to the team. I have experience developing back-office programs that automate tasks previously done manually by team members. Through this process, I acquired additional technical skills beyond my job responsibilities.
  - I consistently keep `records`. I write about various topics related to development on my [blog](https://cookie-dev.tistory.com/).
  - I adhere to `OOP`. I write code based on OOP to make maintenance easier.
  - I consider `code quality` as crucial. To ensure code quality I adhere to writing `test code` consistently.
